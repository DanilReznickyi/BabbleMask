# Babble Mask 🎧

**Babble Mask** is a small Windows app that generates mixed voices to protect speech privacy in rooms and offices.

### 🧠 Idea
It records your voice once and plays multiple mixed layers to make the speech unrecognizable — like people talking at the same time.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- C# / .NET 8 (WinForms)
- NAudio library

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Click **Record** and speak for 10 seconds.
2. Press **Start** — the app will create a babble sound.
3. Use **Stop** to clear recordings.
